# Clima🌦

Clima app enables users to check the weather for their current location using GPS data from their iPhone, or by manually searching for a city. The app was built with the help of the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API, and includes a dark mode feature, which was created using vector images as image assets. The app was designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. Additionally, SF symbols were utilized for designing the app, such as the sunny and cloudy logos.
